# Hactar's Arch Installation Scripts

This is a series of installation scripts I wrote to help with installing Arch. If you are looking to install Arch yourself, I do _not_ recommend that you use these as-is, since these are very personalized to my own needs, however they may serve as a starting point for writing your own. As always, the [Arch Wiki installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) is the best reference rather than someone else's shell scripts.

Some of these scripts are much more friendly than others; use them at your own risk. I make no guarantees that any of them will work.
